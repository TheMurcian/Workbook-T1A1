# Q1 Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time. 300 - 500 words

From military experiment to a tool that has become integrated into almost every facet of life, there have been many significant developments with respect to the internet. This short essay will highlight several key events in this development from the 1980’s until today. The first major development of the 1980’s came from Tim Berners-Lee who in 1980 - whilst at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) - developed ENQUIRE, a notebook program documenting links between people, computers, and also projects - a technique which later became known as hypertext (Press, 2015; Dennis, 2020). This moment proved significant because this initial program gave rise to the idea of the World Wide Web itself. A second major event in the development of the internet arrived in March 1989 when Bernes-Lee began circulating a proposal at CERN entitled “Information Management: A Proposal” which sought to address information loss at the company as well as propose a new way to manage information about accelerators and experiments at CERN (Miller, 2014). The idea was to generate a hypertext-based system over the internet where any part of the text could be linked to a specific document which then, most crucially, could be part of a universally linked system that - as Miller notes - stressed both generality and portability (Miller, 2014). ENQUIRE takes fuller force at CERN, and in the following year the world’s first website and server go live at CERN, along with Bernes-Lee developing the first Web browser, the WorldWideWeb (Pewresearch, 2014). Built over existing IP and TCP protocols, the World Wide Web consisted of: 1) a textual format to represent documents (HTML); 2) a simple protocol allowing exchange between documents (HTTP); 3) a client to display said documents, the first web browser; and 4) a server to give access to a given document (MDN, 2020).

The period between the early 1980’s and especially in the early-to-mid 1990’s saw the transition of the internet from a research and military network, to one accessible by the public, as seen in the decommission of ARPANET in 1990 and by 1991, all four of the world wide web’s building blocks were completed and its servers running outside of CERN (Naughton, 2016; MDN, 2020). This transition to a public project proved another major development in the internet’s history, cemented in 1993 when CERN places it’s technology in the public domain, and in the same year Marc Andreessen proposes IMG HTML tags to allow the display of images - all of which hinting at the potential as well as future trajectory of the internet (Pewresearch, 2014). The final major phase concerning the internet’s development as demarcated by Naughton is from the mid-1990’s until the present, first beginning with the commercialisation of the internet and ending our current state of mobile connectivity, social media, and more recently issues of surveillance and cybercrime (2016). Finally, amongst the most recent developments is the proliferation of social media, chiefly via Mark Zucherberg’s Facebook, which came to dominate the social networking sphere, permanently changing the internet’s landscape. 



# Q2	Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
# - packets
# - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
# - routers and routing
# - domains and DNS
# Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet. 50 - 100 words per dot point

### Packets
Data or information that is sent from one device to another is first broken down into what are called packets. Packets of information then carry the data through the internet - along disparate pathways or routes - to a targeted destination in a reliable and efficient manner. An image, for example may be comprised of millions of bits, and too large to be sent by one packet, so it is then broken down into smaller and more manageable packets and, along with a specified IP address, the packets are then sent via the best available route (Cerf, 2019). 

#### IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
An IP or Internet Protocol address is a unique numeric identity of an interface, originally consisting of four numbers (IPv4). IPv6 later replaced IPv4, allowing for 128-bit addresses and better security. Similar to how postal addresses provide a unique identity to a specific house, an IP address likewise provides an unique address - ordered by a hierarchy of information such as country/network or now networks/sub-networks -  to each device (Cerf, 2019). When visiting a website, one’s computer requests another computer for information by sending a message to it’s IP address with an origin address. The IP address thus allows for a correct correspondence between the devices on the internet, allowing global communication communication and exchange. 

#### Routers and Routing
If packets are the accumulated and broken down pieces of information that are sent across networks, routers are a device that connects and forwards the information between computer networks. This process - called routing - is where some type of data, such as an e-email, is sent off with an IP address with the routers functioning as online traffic managers, ensuring the packets navigate smoothly through the network between other routers, as well as bypassing online congestion and selecting the most optimal route (Cerf, 2019).


### Domains and DNS
Domains or domain names are unique site-names or address that direct to a specific website. Simply, the DNS is a directory of names that match with numbers (i.e., IP addresses). Importantly, it will bridge the language gap between humans and computers by resolving names to numbers - that is - domain names to IP addresses by reviewing domain-names within it’s distributed servers and databases to locate a searched domain-name with it’s corresponding IP address (Shaw & Fruhlinger, 2020). This then allows the computer to communicate with the targeted site or web-server and retrieve the webpage. 

# Q 3: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet (150-300 words per dot point):
 - TCP 
 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) 
Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet
